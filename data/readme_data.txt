Download the data at: https://www.pewresearch.org/dataset/2023-24-religious-landscape-study-rls-dataset/

There should be a button on the right hand side of the screen that says "Download Dataset"

It will download a zip folder. 

Take the '2023-24 RLS Public Use File Feb 19.csv' file and put it in this data folder.
It may come as an xlsx, so you need to convert it to csv. 
Ensure that it matches the exact file name written above.

The csv file needs to be in the data folder for the Jupyter Nodebook (analysis.ipynb) to work.
